# Top-Streamed-Songs-Spotify-

For this project, I analyzed top streamed songs as well as popular artists based on their total stream counts. I also explored any trends within the songs' attributes. The data set used can be found in the following link below. After analyzing the data, I attempted to use machine learning to build a model that can predict the number of streams for a song. Viewers can also find a dashboard version of the analysis in the following link.
